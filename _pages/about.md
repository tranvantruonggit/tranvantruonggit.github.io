Hello there, I am just an engineer living in HCMC. I love exploring the technology and engineering. I strive to understand how thing works, why thing is designed/engineered in this way or that way. I have started blogging since COVID year 2019. This blog is a way I improve my writitng skill and keep track some of my thoughts.

# Profession
I am working for multidisciplinary projects in automotive domain, specifically Electronic Control Unit. My day-to-day is precisely choosing the best solution for our customers in technical point of view, obviously, I am not doing it alone. If you have any inquiry regarding our services/products, feel free to reach me via Linked In or my email [truong@rtos.dev](mailto:truong@rtos.dev)

# Hobby
I do have some small side projects for fun, it may not be related to my job. That somehow keeps me up to date with what's going on with the technology. I love to discuss about engineering and new ideas. I have decent experience about embedded system and alike, if you are intested in that topic, we can have some coffee someday somewhere haha.

# This domain
Yeah, you may wonder why I had this domain, RTOS (Real Time Operating System) is one of my favourite topics in embedded systems, and when Google rolled out the **.dev** domain, I took that chance to register this for me.

# What else
I own a mechanical keyboard, I use track ball in my office, I am a Dvorak typist, well those are kind of things that you can easily recognize myself.
