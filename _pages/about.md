# Hobby
I do have some small side project for fun, it may or may not related to my profession. However, that somehow help me to keep me update with what's going on with the technology.
I love to discuss about engineering and new ideas. I have decent experience about embedded system and alike, if you are intested in that topic, we can have some coffe some day somewhere haha.

# What else
I own a mechanical keyboard, I use track ball in my office, I am an Dvorak typist, well those are kind of things that you can easily recognize myself.
