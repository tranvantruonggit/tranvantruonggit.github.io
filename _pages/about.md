Hello there, I am just an engineer living in HCMC. I love exploring the technology and engineering. I strive to understand how thing works, why thing is designed/engineered this way or that way. I have started blogging since 2019 or sooner (don't remember exactly), This blog is a way I improve my writitng skill and keep track some of my thoughts.

# Profession
I am working for multidisciplinary projects in automotive domain, specifically Electronic Control Unit. My day-to-day is precisely choosing the best solution for our customers in technical point of view, obviously, I am not doing it alone. If you have any inquiry regarding our services/products, feel free to reach me via Linked In or my email [contact@tranvantruong.com](mailto:contact@tranvantruong.com)

# Hobby
I do have some small side projects for fun, it may or may not related to my job. That somehow help me to keep me updated with what's going on with the technology. I love to discuss about engineering and new ideas. I have decent experience about embedded system and alike, if you are intested in that topic, we can have some coffee someday somewhere haha.   

# This domain
Yeah, you may wonder why I had this domain, RTOS (Real Time Operating System) is one of my favourite topics in embedded systems, and when Google rolled out the **.dev** domain, I took that chance to register this for me.

# What else
I own a mechanical keyboard, I use track ball in my office, I am a Dvorak typist, well those are kind of things that you can easily recognize myself.
