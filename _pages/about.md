title: "About me"
---
Hello there! I'm an engineer based in HCMC with a passion for technology and engineering. I'm constantly fascinated by how things work and why they are designed or engineered in certain ways. Blogging has been a great outlet for me since the COVID year of 2019, allowing me to improve my writing skills and document my thoughts along the way.

# Profession
In my professional life, I work on multidisciplinary projects in the automotive domain, specifically Electronic Control Units. Everyday, I collaborate with a team to find the best technical solutions for our customers. If you have any inquiries about our services or products, feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email me at [truong@rtos.dev](mailto:truong@rtos.dev)

# Hobby
Aside from my work, I also indulge in small side projects for fun, even if they are not directly related to my job. These projects help me stay up to date with the latest technology trends. I enjoy discussing engineering concepts and brainstorming new ideas. With a decent experience in embedded systems, I would be thrilled to grab a coffee someday and delve into these topics.

# This domain
You might be wondering why I chose this domain name. Well, RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) is one of my favorite topics in embedded systems. When Google introduced the `.dev domain`, I saw it as a perfect opportunity to register it for myself.

# What else
On a personal note, I'm a proud owner of a mechanical keyboard and I prefer using a trackball in my office setup. Additionally, I'm a Dvorak typist. These are just a few things that easily identify me.
