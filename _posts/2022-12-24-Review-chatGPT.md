Ok, ChatGPT is flooding the media, people are crazy about it. As an guy who codes for food, why not try it then.

# How to start

Just google `open AI chatGPT" and you will be guide to the chatGPT link, unfortunately, at the moment, it is currently geographically blocking Vietnam user, there are several workaround you can find out there.

Let's get started

# The feel

Obviously, as an machine under the hood, chating with it is not something like the human, however, for the purpose I am wanna try, it is interesting than using google search, but it is lke using the google assistance, except that this bot is not internet connected, but use their historical trained data. I guess openAI have provided it massive knowledge.

One think I was always wanna do but hate to learn is the GUI, like [Linus Tovard spoke in TED session with Chris Anderson](https://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux). Then, I have asked the bot to generate the code of simple GUI program (adder of 2 input numbers). As first, to be frank, I am scared of what it can do, it provide the initial version, then I complain, and it provides the revised version, and it did excellence for several round. The fololwing is the simplified *conversation* between myself and the bot.

# Well it is really terifying, but in the end, it is just the massive if-else, isn't it

I am a fool, I am always think of the neural-network works like the massive if-else mesh. After couple of hours 

# What we should propare as an engineer?



# Personal verdict?

Think of how magically our brains are, I don't think we could build the "skynet" that is superior the humankind intelligence in total (and the skynet without weapon connected is harmless, isn't it?), I think the main reason the chatGPT is disconnected from the internet is to ensure that it cannot learn the negative stuff from the humankind, thus their purpose is achieve with just a little side effect. However, as an egineer. What I can see that it can generate the simple code that it would take me a day or so to do, in just a few minute. Thas is really impressive. Then it is that, the chatGPT cannot handle the much of the complexity like a middle engineer, but for simple task like writing some small module we normally see the entry level engineer did, I am afraid that these job will bee soon replace if the cost/performance of chatGPT is considered. The it is not the end of the our career for sure, for instance, before the calculator is invented, we still doing the math on paper. And when the calculator and computational science is rolling out, it is not mean that we can fire the mathenmatician or we can skip the Algebra 101 class in the college. ChatGPT or equivalent tools will be the powerfull tool to do the tedious job of the programming, like the calculation remove our stress of incorrect calculation, or like the computer spreadsheet (and database recently) replace the paper-and-pen book keeping.
