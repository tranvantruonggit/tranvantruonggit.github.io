# Cartesian Product under the perspective of the set theory

I am learning Haskell and I have made some quite non-trivial program and it reaches the point that I need to learn about the Monad/Monoid/Functor ... I feel like I need to back to the basic and discover the thing called **Category Theory** which the whole functional programming rely on. Thanks to google, I have found the lecture of Dr. Bartosz Milewski on youtube about the Category Theory. It is the insightful series of lecture he recorded and this post is just my personal note based on part 5.1 of his series.

# Product of 2 sets

We have been educated about the Cartersian product between 2 sets `a` and `b`  in to create set `c`. The new set have the projection function which the element in `c` to `a` and `b` respectively. For instance, we have the set of real number R, we define the set that is `R x R` , the (x,y) is element in `RxR` actually denote a point in a plane. In the view of the category theory, there will be category define the product of 2 object.
